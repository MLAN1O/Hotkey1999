## What‚Äôs This?

I wanted a faster way to open my go-to web pages ‚Äî dashboards, feeds, camera views ‚Äî without dealing with browsers or tabs.

So I made this tool:  
Bind any URL to a hotkey and launch it instantly in a fullscreen window.  
No load time, no clicks ‚Äî it just appears. Press the same hotkey again, and it‚Äôs gone.

Perfect for:
* **Instantly popping up your camera grid, dashboard, or any web tool**
* **Keeping monitoring screens one keystroke away ‚Äî no browser delays**
* **Dodging tab overload by giving your go-to web app its own shortcut**
* **Feeling like a hacker every time a fullscreen web page appears out of nowhere**

## Cool Features

* ‚ö° **Instant Launch:** Opens your web page in milliseconds ‚Äî no loading, no waiting.
* üñ•Ô∏è **Fullscreen by Default:** Clean, borderless, distraction-free. Just like a native app.
* ‚å®Ô∏è **Hotkey for Everything:** Assign a custom hotkey to each profile (Numpad and modifiers supported).
* üóÇÔ∏è **Multiple Profiles:** Set up different URLs with unique names and shortcuts.
* ü™ü **Smart Window Sizing:** Want it smaller than fullscreen? Press F11, resize it ‚Äî we‚Äôll remember it for next time.
* üîÅ **Quick Refresh:** Hit F5 to reload the original URL instantly.
* üöÄ **Start with Windows:** Keep it ready in the background from the moment you log in.
* ‚öôÔ∏è **Lightweight & Silent:** One tray icon, one background process. That‚Äôs it.

## Getting Started

Here‚Äôs how to get things rolling.

### Install It

### Option 1: Use the Release (Recommended)

1.  Go to the [Releases page](https://github.com/MLAN1O/Hotkey1999/releases) of this repository.
2.  Download and run the latest installer (`.exe`).

### Option 2: Build from Source

1.  **Run for development:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/MLAN1O/Hotkey1999.git
    cd Hotkey1999
    npm install
    npm start
    ```

2.  **Build your own executable:**
    ```bash
    npm run dist
    ```
    This will create an installer in the `dist` folder.

### How to Use

Right-click the tray icon and hit `Settings` to manage your profiles.

- Use `New Profile` to add one, or click an existing profile to edit.
- Set a name, URL, and hotkey using the visual picker.
- Don‚Äôt forget to `Save Changes` if you're done with it.
- To auto-launch with Windows, just toggle `Start with Windows` in the tray menu.

## Works On

This app was made with Electron and is mainly tested on **Windows**.

It might run on macOS or Linux, but keep in mind:
- The ‚ÄúStart with Windows‚Äù option won‚Äôt work out of the box.
- You‚Äôll probably need to set up a custom startup script on those platforms.
